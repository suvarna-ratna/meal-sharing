        <h5>Whether it’s fruit, vegetables, or dairy, there’s a lot of food waste in the world each day.
          Luckily, many new food sharing apps are working to provide solutions!</h5>
        <hr />
        <p>The sharing culture has become an important part of how people provide and access services in recent years.
          It helps to bridge the gap between those who have an abundance and those who have significant needs.
          It's also a wonderful way to forge meaningful connections as we can share new experiences through food and family.

          Whether companies are looking for ways to reduce food waste or families are looking for a homemade entrée, food sharing apps can help bring communities together.
          Do you all have any favorite food sharing apps? Let us know on social #getMealSharingApp!</p>
